About This Project
This project is a personal webpage created with a lighthearted spirit, showcasing my journey and skills in web development. It's a demonstration of everything I've learned in my web development class, including CSS classes, Flexbox layouts, animations, and responsive design.

Built with a blend of Bootstrap, custom CSS, and HTML, this project reflects my growth and creativity in web design. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it!
